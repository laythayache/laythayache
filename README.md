## Public Repositories

Below is a selection of my primary public GitHub repositories. Each project reflects hands-on experience in AI, data engineering, web development, and embedded systems.

- **[KNN_decision_trees_and_Naiive_bayes_FromScratch](https://github.com/laythayache/KNN_decision_trees_and_Naiive_bayes_FromScratch)**  
  A collection of from-scratch implementations for k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Naïve Bayes classifiers in Python. Includes example scripts that load the Iris dataset, train each model, and report accuracy.

- **[ETL_pipelines](https://github.com/laythayache/ETL_pipelines)**  
  Demonstrates end-to-end ETL processes on low-level datasets. Contains Python scripts for extracting, transforming, and loading CSV data into SQLite, showcasing pipeline robustness and efficiency.

- **[Linear_algebra_library_python](https://github.com/laythayache/Linear_algebra_library_python)**  
  A lightweight linear algebra library built in Python. Implements vector and matrix operations (addition, multiplication, inversion, eigenvalue computation) without external dependencies.

- **[dataset-collector](https://github.com/laythayache/dataset-collector)**  
  A toolkit for structured dataset creation, specifically tailored for Arabic Sign Language (ArSL). Includes a Python GUI to capture, label, and organize image/video samples.

- **[Breast-cancer-ML](https://github.com/laythayache/Breast-cancer-ML)**  
  One of my early machine learning projects: builds a classification model to predict breast cancer malignancy using standard datasets. Demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- **[Training-the-ASL-dataset](https://github.com/laythayache/Training-the-ASL-dataset)**  
  Step-by-step process for building an American Sign Language (ASL) recognition model. Covers data collection, preprocessing, and training with TensorFlow and OpenCV.

- **[BE](https://github.com/laythayache/BE)**  
  Backend utilities and scripts for various engineering courses. Includes sample code for signal processing, control systems, and embedded applications.

- **[laythayache](https://github.com/laythayache/laythayache)**  
  Personal website and portfolio repository. Static site built with HTML/CSS showcasing my resume, project summaries, and contact information.

- **[ML-walkthrough](https://github.com/laythayache/ML-walkthrough)**  
  A Jupyter Notebook tutorial illustrating the foundational steps to begin a machine learning journey. Covers data exploration, feature engineering, and basic model training.
